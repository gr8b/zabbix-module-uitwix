### Tweaks

- Enable filters to remain visible within the viewing area when scrolling through tables with extensive data.
- Allow users to manually reposition modal windows within the body area.\
  _Please note that manually changing the position of the modal window is not saved._

### Development

Clone repository, run `composer install` to initialize composer packages, then can use `composer run dev-watch --timeout 0` to rebuild `.css` automatically when `assets/less/uitwix.less` file is changed.
